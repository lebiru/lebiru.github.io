            <p>Itâ€™s the night before the big debut of your online store. The clock is ticking, and every minute brings
                you closer to the site going live. Suddenly, the site launches, and pre-orders start flooding in! You
                rejoice and celebrate, until you encounter the dreaded error message: 500 Internal Server Error. Your
                fans canâ€™t process orders, and the app is buckling under the spike in users. Could this disaster have
                been prevented?</p>
            <p>Stress Testing is the key to ensuring your application can handle waves of requests and operations during
                an extended period of time. In this blog post, we will dive into what stress testing is, provide an
                overview of Jmeter, and run a stress test against my app, Lebiru.FileService. Letâ€™s dive in!</p>

        <section>
            <h2>What is Stress Testing?</h2>
            <p>Stress testing is a type of performance testing that evaluates how an application behaves under extreme
                workloads, such as heavy user traffic or resource utilization. It ensures the application maintains
                stability, functionality, and performance when pushed beyond its limits. Stress testing can reveal
                bottlenecks, memory leaks, and other critical issues that could hinder the appâ€™s performance in
                production.</p>
            <p>There are various types of stress tests, each designed for specific scenarios:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Run-to-Failure Test:</strong> This test pushes the application until it fails, helping
                    identify the breaking point and critical weak spots.</li>
                <li><strong>Timed Stress Test:</strong> This test evaluates how the application performs under heavy
                    load for a specific period of time.</li>
                <li><strong>Soak Test:</strong> This checks the applicationâ€™s performance under sustained heavy load
                    over an extended duration, ensuring long-term reliability.</li>
                <li><strong>Spike Test:</strong> This test assesses how the application handles sudden spikes in user
                    traffic.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why is Stress Testing Important?</h2>
            <p>Stress testing plays a critical role in software development by ensuring that applications can handle
                real-world scenarios. It helps identify vulnerabilities that might otherwise go unnoticed in standard
                testing environments. With stress testing, developers can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Improve Stability:</strong> Identify and fix bottlenecks, ensuring the application can
                    handle high demand.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhance Scalability:</strong> Determine the capacity limits and plan for scaling resources
                    accordingly.</li>
                <li><strong>Boost Confidence:</strong> Gain assurance that the application will perform reliably under
                    heavy loads.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Stress tests typically involve software developers, QA engineers, and system administrators. They are
                conducted in staging or pre-production environments that closely replicate the production setup to
                provide accurate results.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Jmeter: The Defacto Stress Testing Open Source Tool</h2>
            <p>Apache Jmeter, currently at version 5.6.3, is a powerful open-source tool for stress testing. It
                simulates heavy user traffic and measures the performance of web applications under load. Jmeter is
                widely used for its flexibility and ability to test various protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and JDBC.</p>
            <h3>Jmeter Test Plan</h3>
            <p>A Jmeter test plan outlines the testing workflow, defining the actions to be performed during the test.
                It serves as the blueprint for all test configurations and components.</p>
            <h3>Jmeter Thread Group</h3>
            <p>The thread group defines the number of virtual users (threads) and the testâ€™s duration. By configuring
                the thread count, ramp-up period, and loop count, you can simulate different user loads.</p>
            <h3>Jmeter HTTP Request</h3>
            <p>The HTTP request sampler specifies the requests to be sent to the server. You can configure parameters
                such as the endpoint URL, request method (GET, POST, etc.), and payload.</p>
            <h3>Jmeter View Results Tree Listener</h3>
            <p>The View Results Tree Listener provides a detailed log of each request and response during the test. Itâ€™s
                useful for debugging and analyzing specific transactions.</p>
            <h3>Jmeter Summary Report Listener</h3>
            <p>The Summary Report Listener provides an aggregated view of test results, including metrics like response
                time, throughput, and error rate.</p>
            <p>Configuring a Jmeter test is straightforward using its UI. Navigate to <strong>File > New</strong> to
                create a new test plan, then add components via <strong>Right-click > Add > Threads (Users) > Thread
                    Group</strong>, and so on. Each componentâ€™s settings can be adjusted via the properties panel.</p>
            <p>Jmeter test plans are saved as <code>.jmx</code> files, allowing them to be version controlled and edited
                as plain text. This makes it easy to collaborate and automate testing workflows.</p>
